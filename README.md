# OpenRemote Fleet Management Integration v1
test
![CI/CD](https://github.com/openremote/fleet-management/workflows/CI/CD/badge.svg)
[![Open Source? Yes!](https://badgen.net/badge/Open%20Source%20%3F/Yes%21/blue?icon=github)](https://github.com/Naereen/badges/)

This repository contains the OpenRemote custom project that contains full support for fleet management features, like 
location tracking and session tracking, and also the industry-first **complete, automatic data recognition** from any 
Teltonika Telematics device model.

Please look at the wiki for the tutorial on how to set up your own fleet management system, and the Developer Guide to 
understand the inner workings of the fleet management implementation.

## Quickstart

An online demo will be made available to the public shortly, but you can still run the OpenRemote fleet management 
implementation locally using Docker:

The quickest way to get your own environment with full access is to make use of our docker images (both `amd64` and 
`arm64` are supported). 
1. Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed (v18+). 
2. Download the docker compose file:
[OpenRemote Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openremote/fleet-management/master/docker-compose.yml) (Right click 'Save link as...')
3. In a terminal `cd` to where you just saved the compose file and then run:
```
    docker-compose -p fleet-management up -d
```
If all goes well then you should now be able to access the OpenRemote Manager UI at [https://localhost](https://localhost). 
You will need to accept the self-signed certificate, see [here](https://www.technipages.com/google-chrome-bypass-your-connection-is-not-private-message) for details how to do this in Chrome 
(similar for other browsers).

To configure the devices and OpenRemote to properly communicate, check the tutorial and quickstart guides in the wiki.

### Login credentials
Username: admin  
Password: secret

### Changing host and/or port
The URL you use to access the system is important, the default is configured as `https://localhost` if you are using a VM or want to run on a different port then you will need to set the `OR_HOSTNAME` and `OR_SSL_PORT` environment variables, so if for example you will be accessing using `https://192.168.1.1:8443` then use the following startup command:

BASH:
```
OR_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.1 OR_SSL_PORT=8443 docker-compose -p fleet-management up -d
```
or

CMD:
```
cmd /C "set OR_HOSTNAME=192.168.1.1 && set OR_SSL_PORT=8443 && docker-compose -p fleet-management up -d"
```


# Custom Project Format

To create the OpenRemote fleet management integration, a new custom project was created using [OpenRemote's custom-project template](https://github.com/openremote/custom-project). To view the changes of files between the original custom-project repository and the current state of the repository, press [here]( https://github.com/openremote/fleet-management/compare/668ae6fdfb20eeae5977ad62b655bf3fb3d58cdd...main). In this way, you can see the files that have been added since the creation of this repository. 

This repository uses the [feature/fleet-management](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/tree/feature/fleet-management) branch of the main OpenRemote repository as its core, specifically for adding more UI-related features. If the UI features are not something that interest you, you're encouraged to change the submodule to use the `master` OpenRemote branch.
